    <h2>About Right Life</h2>
    <p>
	Among other things, a good life is about being happy, feeling secure and having as much fun as possible. 
	If you make the right life choices most of the time, a good life will come naturally. 
	That’s how Right Life came to be the name. 
	Silly? Maybe. But it’s helped guide me in my life choices, including financial decisions.<br /><br />
	Right Life was designed to help people get their financial house in order. Financial stress is the leading cause of stress for Americans. 
	Financial stress has a negative impact on everything-job performance, physical and mental health and relationships. 
	Our schools don’t teach enough about personal finances, it’s not talked about or taught enough in the home, and financial companies are out to make money. 
	By the time adulthood comes around, most people are confused on what to do or worse, have given up on being financially secure and are just trying to get by. 
	Getting by isn’t good enough. We all work too hard to just get by. 
	We should be striving for a good life…being happy, feeling secure and having as much fun as possible, while keeping our financial house in order.<br /><br /> 
	I’ve been helping people with money and financial decisions for more than 20 years. 
	I’ve worked to help people build and repair credit, develop attainable budgets, select the right financial products and services, and a number of other things. 
	Every situation is different. We all have different goals. We all have different needs. That’s why each plan is different. A plan will be designed for you and your needs.
