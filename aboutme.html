<h3>Tonja Pilafas</h3>

  <p>I grew up learning hard work from my parents. 
	I watched them put in extra hours, take educated risks and make the right financial moves. 
	I learned lessons from them when they didn’t think I was even paying attention. 
	I’m grateful to my parents for so many things, especially for the financial education they gave. <br /> <br />

	I’ve been working in the financial industry since 1994. My focus has always been to help people make the best decisions, use the most beneficial products and make the most of their money. 
	I have saved people money by finding better loan and credit card options. 
	I have worked with people on budgeting and savings plans. 
	Together, I have worked with individuals and couples to build credit and put plans together based on what is important to them. 
	Finances are personal and everyone has different goals. 
	My goals are to help you meet your goals.
